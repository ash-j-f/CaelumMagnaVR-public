# Caelum Magna VR Star Map made with Amazon Lumberyard

This repository serves as a reference for Lumberyard game project source code using the PLY PostgreSQL Database connector Gem https://github.com/ash-j-f/PLY-public

Until the star database creation and import process is documented, the project is not currently usable.

For a preview of the star map, check out a video of the prototype at https://youtu.be/VHa8dVGE2vs
